## 🏗️ Current Architecture Summary

The Investim client is a **Next.js 15** mobile-first investment assistant application built with:

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI components)
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence and optimistic updates
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright E2E
- **API Integration**: Next.js API routes with caching and error handling
- **Build & Deploy**: Netlify with optimized bundles and CI/CD
- **Performance**: Code splitting, memoization, and Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Major Improvements Implemented ✅

**Phase 1: Foundation & Security**
✅ **Build Quality** - Fixed TypeScript/ESLint configuration, zero build errors  
✅ **Security Hardening** - Added XSS protection with DOMPurify  
✅ **Error Boundaries** - Production-grade error handling and monitoring  

**Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure**
✅ **Unit Testing** - Jest + React Testing Library with 70%+ coverage  
✅ **E2E Testing** - Playwright for critical user journeys  
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions with automated quality gates  

**Phase 3: Component Architecture**
✅ **Chatbot Refactoring** - Decomposed 377-line monolith into focused components  
✅ **Custom Hooks** - useChatbot, useRiskQuiz, useChatAPI for logic separation  
✅ **Single Responsibility** - All components now <100 lines with clear purposes  

**Phase 4: Performance Optimization**
✅ **Bundle Optimization** - Reduced from 502kB to optimized chunk loading  
✅ **Code Splitting** - Dynamic imports and route-based splitting  
✅ **Core Web Vitals** - Performance monitoring and budget enforcement  

**Phase 5: State Management**
✅ **Zustand Integration** - Centralized state with persistence  
✅ **Specialized Stores** - Portfolio, goals, chat, and UI state management  
✅ **Optimistic Updates** - Enhanced user experience with immediate feedback  

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas

### Completed Objectives ✅
1. ✅ **Testing Framework** - Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright implemented
2. ✅ **Component Refactoring** - Chatbot decomposed into focused components

2. **PWA Enhancement** - Offline capability and service workers
3. **Advanced Analytics** - User behavior tracking and performance insights
4. **Micro-Frontend Preparation** - Module federation and independent deployments

### Strategic Initiatives
1. **API Rate Limiting** - Enhanced backend protection and request throttling
2. **Advanced Caching** - Multi-layer caching with Redis integration
3. **Accessibility Compliance** - WCAG 2.1 AA certification
4. **International Expansion** - i18n support and localization framework
