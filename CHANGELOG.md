# Changelog â€” Investim Client

## [Unreleased]

## [2025-01-03] Major Codebase Refactoring
### Architecture Improvements
- **Component Breakdown**: Reduced main `app/page.tsx` from 274 lines to 28 lines (90% reduction)
- **Created Dashboard Components**: Split into 6 focused components (`UserHeader`, `PortfolioSummary`, `GoalsSection`, `PerformanceTabs`, `PeriodSelector`, `ChatInterface`)
- **Improved File Structure**: Added organized directories for `constants/`, `types/`, `data/`, and `components/Dashboard/`

### Code Quality Enhancements
- **Eliminated Code Duplication**: Removed 143 lines of duplicate `AssetAllocationChart` implementation
- **Centralized Configuration**: Created unified color system in `constants/colors.ts` and icon management in `constants/icons.ts`
- **Shared Type Definitions**: Consolidated duplicate interfaces into `types/index.ts`
- **Data Extraction**: Moved hardcoded portfolio data and quiz questions to dedicated data files

### Type Safety & Error Handling
- **Fixed TypeScript Issues**: Removed all `any` types and implemented proper error handling with custom error classes
- **Environment Validation**: Added `lib/env.ts` with proper validation and error handling for API routes
- **Enhanced API Security**: Improved error handling in RAG API route with sanitized error messages

### Developer Experience
- **Standardized Exports**: Converted all components to use named exports consistently
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with single responsibility components
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` for development guidance

## [2025-04-16] AddGoalForm & GoalManager Major UX/UI Update

- Add Goal and Cancel buttons are on the same row; Add Goal button uses #079669 for brand consistency.

- The Add New Goal button is always displayed at the bottom of the list.
- Improved accessibility: Dialog now includes DialogTitle for screen readers.
